### Reflection
- During this project I learned how to research and implement new technologies in a short amount of time. By taking time to research what I needed from the new technologies I was able to implement them in a more timely manner.
- Although the learning curve for cypress was a bit steep at first, it was extremely rewarding.  Cypress made it possible to test error handling with our server, and made sure we could test different user flows.
